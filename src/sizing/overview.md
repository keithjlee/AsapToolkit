# Sizing Toolkit
This submodule contains tools necessary to optimally size a structural element with given geometric and force demands. Current work is headed by Tasha H. and focusses on structural steel design following AISC 360. Includes:

- Flexural design including higher-order design checks:
  - stability
  - warping
  - local buckling
  - shear buckling
- Axial design including:
  - buckling
  - local buckling
  - torsional stability
  

Should eventually integrate:
- Connection design
  - Recursively interacts with element resistance due to gross area reductions
- Lateral/seismic design requirements
